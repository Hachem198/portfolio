    Hello! My name is Omar Salhi, and I’m a passionate full-stack developer with over six years of experience building scalable,
    high-performance web applications. I specialize in JavaScript and TypeScript, working extensively with modern frameworks like
    React, Next.js, and Vue.js on the frontend, while leveraging Node.js with NestJS and Express.js on the backend. My journey 
    started with a deep curiosity for technology, leading me to develop a strong foundation in databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB,
    and MySQL, ensuring robust and efficient data management. Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, 
    from e-commerce platforms and SaaS applications to enterprise-level content management systems. One of my proudest achievements was 
    leading the development of a multi-tenant platform that streamlined business operations for over 500 clients, integrating microservices 
    architecture and cloud solutions using AWS and Docker. I am also well-versed in DevOps practices, implementing CI/CD pipelines, containerization,
    and serverless computing to optimize deployment workflows. Beyond coding, I enjoy mentoring junior developers, conducting code reviews, and
    contributing to open-source projects. My ability to collaborate across teams, coupled with my problem-solving skills, allows me to deliver 
    innovative solutions that drive business success. I’m always eager to learn new technologies, refine my expertise, and take on challenges that 
    push the boundaries of web development.
