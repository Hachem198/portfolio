    Hello! My name is Omar Salhi, and I’m a passionate full-stack developer with over four years of experience building scalable,
    high-performance web applications. I specialize in JavaScript and TypeScript, working extensively with modern frameworks like React,
    Next.js, and Vue.js on the frontend, while leveraging Node.js with NestJS and Express.js on the backend. My journey began at a young age
    with a deep curiosity for technology, which led me to study Computer Science at the University of Tunis El Manar and quickly immerse myself
    in real-world projects. Over the years, I’ve built and contributed to diverse applications ranging from e-commerce platforms and SaaS tools
    to enterprise-level systems. One of my proudest achievements was co-leading the development of a multi-tenant platform serving over 300 clients,
    built with a microservices architecture and cloud-native technologies like AWS and Docker. I’m also familiar with DevOps practices,
    including CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and serverless infrastructure to streamline deployment and development workflows.
    Beyond coding, I enjoy mentoring interns, participating in open-source communities, and sharing knowledge through blogs and tech events.
    My enthusiasm for learning, strong collaboration skills, and love for building practical, impactful software continue to drive my growth as a developer.
